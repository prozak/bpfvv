**bpfvv** stands for BPF Verifier Visualizer

https://theihor.github.io/bpfvv/

This project is an experiment about visualizing Linux Kernel BPF verifier log to help BPF programmers with debugging verification failures. 

The user can load a text file, and the app will attempt to parse it as a verifier log. Successfully parsed lines produce a state which is then visualized in the UI. You can think of this as a primitive debugger UI, except it interprets a log and not a runtime state of a program.

This is a self-contained web app that runs entirely on the client side. There is no backend server. Once loaded, it operates within the browser.
